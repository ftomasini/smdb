pgwatch is a tool to monitor PostgreSQL database servers. It contains a set of
predefined graphs and easy to use tools. It has been designed to provide
sophisticated PostgreSQL monitoring without having to worry about collecting the
data yourself. We hope our customers and users of PostgreSQL can benefit greatly
from simplified monitoring.


Requirements:
-------------

You will need a handful of components to make this work:

	- Apache (webserver)
	- PHP 5  (scripting language)
	- pgsql extension for PHP (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pgsql.php)
	- PostgreSQL 9 (to store the data we collect)
	- dblink (contribution module for PostgreSQL 9)

	- For now we only support PostgreSQL >= 9.0 databases.
	  Older systems cannot be monitored, however, we will
	  add support for future database releases.
	

How to set it up:
----------------- 

	- Extract your package to your Apache directory

	- Adjust ownership of your application if www-data is improper

	- Open in browser the setup.php. It will lead you through the setup process.
	
	- You can choose setup.sh in linux and setup.bat in windows as alternatives.

	- Start the data collection daemon by adding the proper row to cron, something like:
		0 * * * * cd /var/www/pgwatch/util && /usr/bin/php5 getraw_d.php
		(But setup.sh will also remind you of it)

	- Log into the website and click "configure" to add new database servers
	  / databases to make sure that your daemon will pick up the statistics.
	

	- Enjoy your tool
